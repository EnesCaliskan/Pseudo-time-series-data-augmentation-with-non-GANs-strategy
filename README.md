----Abstract----

Rapid technological advancements have made data play an extremely critical role in the modern world. As its importance grows, so does the demand for reliable, accessible, and high-quality data. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution to meet this demand and address data scarcity, privacy restrictions, and inconsistent data quality. Time series stands out among various types of data due to its widespread presence in major industries.

While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used for time series generation, they often suffer from training instability and a lack of interpretability. This thesis explores a Bayesian approach for synthesizing pseudo-time series using the PyMC3 framework, incorporating Gaussian Random Walks and hierarchical priors to model shared and individual trends across time series samples. The generated tries are postprocessed using smoothing techniques to reduce noise and increase performance while preserving temporal structure. A comprehensive set of metrics is used to evaluate the fidelity of the synthetic data. Furthermore, a classification-based transferability analysis is introduced to uncover the limitations and shortcomings of these series, which traditional evaluation metrics often overlook. The results show that Bayesian-generated time series, especially when postprocessed, can effectively replicate key statistical properties of real data, offering a fast, interpretable, and viable alternative to GAN-based approaches.
